## 2. Conduct a Team Retrospective

### Purpose
To evaluate the team’s performance and collect constructive feedback after completing the project.

### Retrospective Summary
A team retrospective meeting was held to review the overall collaboration, workflow, and challenges during the Smart Traveler MVP development.  
All communication and coordination among team members were carried out through **Telegram**, ensuring real-time updates and smooth collaboration.

### Key Discussion Points

**What Worked Well**
- Continuous collaboration through Telegram facilitated quick decision-making.  
- Clear division of responsibilities between development, SCM, and QA roles.  
- The Agile sprint process improved task visibility and time management.  
- Regular code reviews enhanced quality and consistency.

**Challenges**
- Minor delays occurred when synchronizing between design updates and code implementation.  
- Some tasks took longer than expected due to API rate-limit handling and model tuning.  
- Maintaining consistent visual styling required additional review cycles.

**Resolutions**
- Improved communication flow using pinned Telegram messages and shared progress summaries.  
- Established a mini check-in routine every two days to track progress and resolve blockers early.  
- Implemented clearer task definitions before each sprint.

**Future Improvements**
- Introduce automated sprint-tracking tools integrated with Telegram for better visibility.  
- Allocate more time for usability testing before final delivery.  
- Encourage team members to document technical changes in real time.

### Outcome
The retrospective concluded that team communication and collaboration were highly effective overall, with actionable improvements identified for upcoming projects. The insights from this discussion have been integrated into the **Lessons Learned** section of the final report.
