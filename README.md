Stage 1 Report: Team Formation and Idea Development
Team Formation Overview

Team Members:

Hamad Dahash - Project Manager

Suhail Alaboud

Khaled Aldawsari

Abrar Almukhlaifi

Communication & Decision-Making Process:
The team communicates primarily via Telegram. Decisions are made through consensus, where all members participate in discussions and agree on the final decisions.

Ideas Explored

The team brainstormed several project ideas but agreed on the current idea of a travel website that provides travel recommendations based on user inputs such as budget, preferences, and other relevant factors. The website will offer users suggestions for destinations, the cost of traveling, and local attractions.

Rejected Ideas: Other ideas were discussed but were rejected due to feasibility or market demand. These ideas weren't specified in detail, but the reason for rejection was either lack of uniqueness or technical challenges.

Selected MVP Concept

The MVP for this project will combine two key functionalities:

Travel destination suggestions based on the userâ€™s budget, preferences, and travel dates.

Detailed travel cost breakdowns, including accommodation, transportation, and a list of recommended tourist attractions in the selected country.

The MVP concept was chosen based on:

Feasibility: The idea is technically viable, as it leverages readily available APIs for travel data.

Innovation: The combination of personalized travel suggestions and cost breakdown is a unique approach that is not widely available in the Arab market.

Alignment with goals: The concept aligns with the team's goal to create a tool that simplifies travel planning for users while making the process more accessible and efficient.

Challenges and Opportunities

Challenges:

API Integration: One of the main technical challenges will be integrating various travel-related APIs (flight data, hotel prices, and tourist attractions).

Data Accuracy and Updates: Ensuring the data is up-to-date and accurate for users will be a continuous challenge. Regularly updating the travel-related data will be essential to keep the website reliable.

Opportunities:

The idea fills a gap in the Arab market where such comprehensive travel planning tools are limited.

There is an opportunity to expand the platform by offering additional services, such as booking flights, hotels, or tour packages, making it a one-stop solution for travelers.

Documentation & Process

The team has begun documenting the decision-making process using Google Docs to keep track of all discussions and decisions. This will ensure that all team members are aligned and informed.
