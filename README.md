## Project Objectives
**Purpose:** Simplify travel planning by generating personalized itineraries based on user preferences, budget, and travel styles.

**Objectives:**
- Provide destination suggestions aligned with the user’s budget and travel duration.  
- Deliver detailed cost breakdowns, accommodations, and attractions.  
- Include essential safety and practical travel tips.  
- Implement an AI-powered API workflow: the system sends a structured prompt containing user inputs (e.g., budget, travel duration, preferences) to the AI model, which generates a personalized travel itinerary.  
- Integrate **SerpAPI** as a complementary tool to fetch real-time web data (e.g., updated accommodation options, flight details, local attractions, reviews, and prices) to enrich and validate the AI-generated results.

## Risks and Mitigation
| Risk                                      | Mitigation Strategy                                             |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Team members lack experience with tools.  | Schedule tutorials and assign early learning sessions.          |
| Timeline delays due to technical issues.  | Break down tasks into smaller milestones with buffer time.      |
| Dependency on external APIs (AI, SerpAPI).| Maintain fallback options and cache results when possible.      |
| Ambiguity in user requirements.           | Conduct short validation sessions with test users.              |
