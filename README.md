# Stage 1 Report: Team Formation and Idea Development

## Team Formation Overview

**Team Members:**
- Hamad Dahash - Project Manager
- Suhail Alaboud
- Khaled Aldawsari
- Abrar Almukhlaifi

**Communication & Decision-Making Process:**
The team communicates primarily via Telegram. Decisions are made through consensus, where all members participate in discussions and agree on the final decisions.

## Ideas Explored

The team brainstormed several project ideas but agreed on the current idea of a travel website that provides travel recommendations based on user inputs such as budget, preferences, and other relevant factors. The website will offer users suggestions for destinations, the cost of traveling, and local attractions.

**Rejected Ideas:** 
Other ideas were discussed but were rejected due to feasibility or market demand. These ideas weren't specified in detail, but the reason for rejection was either lack of uniqueness or technical challenges.

## Selected MVP Concept

The MVP for this project will combine two key functionalities:
- Travel destination suggestions based on the user’s budget, preferences, and travel dates.
- Detailed travel cost breakdowns, including accommodation, transportation, and a list of recommended tourist attractions in the selected country.

The MVP concept was chosen based on:
- **Feasibility:** The idea is technically viable, as it leverages readily available APIs for travel data.
- **Innovation:** The combination of personalized travel suggestions and cost breakdown is a unique approach that is not widely available in the Arab market.
- **Alignment with goals:** The concept aligns with the team's goal to create a tool that simplifies travel planning for users while making the process more accessible and efficient.

## Challenges and Opportunities

**Challenges:**
- **API Integration:** One of the main technical challenges will be integrating various travel-related APIs (flight data, hotel prices, and tourist attractions).
- **Data Accuracy and Updates:** Ensuring the data is up-to-date and accurate for users will be a continuous challenge. Regularly updating the travel-related data will be essential to keep the website reliable.

**Opportunities:**
- The idea fills a gap in the Arab market where such comprehensive travel planning tools are limited.
- There is an opportunity to expand the platform by offering additional services, such as booking flights, hotels, or tour packages, making it a one-stop solution for travelers.

**Documentation & Process:**
The team has begun documenting the decision-making process using Google Docs to keep track of all discussions and decisions. This will ensure that all team members are aligned and informed.

# Task 2: Research and Brainstorming

## 1. Individual and Group Research

### Individual Research:
Each team member researched various aspects of the travel industry, focusing on:
- Real-world problems in travel planning.
- Industry trends in personalized travel services.
- Innovative solutions in the travel market.

### Group Research:
After individual research, the team discussed the ideas and selected those that aligned with the project’s goals.

## 2. Brainstorming Session

**Techniques Used:**
- **Mind Mapping:** We visualized the main idea (smart travel website) and connected related ideas like destination suggestions, cost, and attractions.
- **SCAMPER Framework:** We applied SCAMPER to explore ways to innovate current travel services (e.g., combining flight and hotel booking, adapting existing platforms).
- **"How Might We" Questions:** Examples include: "How might we personalize travel recommendations based on budget?" and "How can we display transparent pricing for users?"

## 3. Selected MVP Concept

The chosen MVP is a smart travel website that:
- Suggests destinations based on user preferences and budget.
- Provides detailed travel costs, accommodations, and local attractions.

This idea was selected because of its feasibility (easy to integrate APIs), innovation (offers a unique approach), and alignment with team goals.

## 4. Challenges and Opportunities

**Challenges:**
- **API Integration:** Integrating data from different sources will be a challenge.
- **Data Accuracy:** Keeping the data updated regularly to ensure reliability.

**Opportunities:**
- There is a gap in the Arab market for a personalized travel platform.
- Potential to expand the platform to include additional services like flight bookings or hotel reservations.

## 5. Documentation

All ideas and decisions were documented using Google Docs for transparency and future reference.
